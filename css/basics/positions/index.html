        <h1>To see the effect of sticky positioning, select the position: sticky option and scroll this container.

            The element will scroll along with its container, until it is at the top of the container (or reaches the
            offset specified in top), and will then stop scrolling, so it stays visible.

            The rest of this text is only supplied to make sure the container overflows, so as to enable you to scroll
            it and see the effect.

            Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a
            small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly
            insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they
            still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
